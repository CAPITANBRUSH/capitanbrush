        <p>
          The course fee is non-refundable. Access to online materials is
          granted to the student until they secure their first job. Any
          distribution, copying, plagiarism, or unauthorized and unapproved
          access with the mentor to any course content, including block content,
          videos, mentoring, contacts, and attachments, is expressly prohibited
          and will be penalized with a payment 100 times the value of the
          infringed material. Online mentoring can be rescheduled in agreement
          with the mentor with at least 3 days' notice. After the mentoring and
          while the student is seeking their first job, support is offered via
          *WhatsApp* for occasional inquiries.
